Re-creat the DOM manipulation features from scratch using recursive Javascript.

This repo contains the methods GetElementByClassName, JSONstringify and parseJSON.

The parseJSON was based on Douglas Crockford's Javascript the Good Parts, an excellent book about Javascript. 
The book is a bit dated, since it came out before the ES6 features were incorporated into the language.
